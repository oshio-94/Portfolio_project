# The Maze Portfolio Project
----------------------------------------------
The Maze Project is a simple 3D game that handles keyboard/mouse input in order to move and control the players. Its meant to be a fun and interactive game which I developed in order to learn a new language, showcase my skill and to also have fun while doing so.
